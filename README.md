# Phishlets
Phishlets are the configuration files in **YAML** syntax for proxying a legitimate website into a phishing website. They are the building blocks of the tool named `evilginx2`. https://github.com/kgretzky/evilginx2. 

## Usage
These phishlets are added in support of some issues in evilginx2 which needs some consideration. All the phishlets here are tested and built on the modified version of evilginx2: [https://github.com/hash3liZer/evilginx2](https://github.com/hash3liZer/evilginx2). If you find any problem regarding the current version or with any phishlet, make sure to report the issue on github.
